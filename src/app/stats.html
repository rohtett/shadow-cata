  <h2>Statistic Explanations</h2>
    <section>
      <b>Intellect</b> is the most beneficial stat to have. Above all, this stat provides you with spell power which directly increases the damage of all of your spells. Intellect will also grant you increased critical strike chance and a higher mana pool which will be of great importance to a Shadow Priest for more spell usage as well as higher mana gains (through percentage of maximum mana).

    <section>
      <b>Spirit and Hit Rating</b> will reduce your chance to miss against enemies. This is important as any missed attacks will not deal any damage this includes casted and channeled spells as well as application of damage over time effects. The amount of hit needed is based off the level of your target, and for all raid encounters this value is set to 17%. As a Shadow Priest you also gain hit rating equal to 100% of spirit rating that you have, so having either stat will help you to reach this cap.

    <br />
    <section>
      <b>Haste</b> will affect the speed at which all of your spells will channel and cast. It also affects the rate at which your damage over time (DoT) effects will deal damage. For DoTs, the faster damage instances mean that each cast will deal more damage over the same time.

    <section>
      <b>Mastery</b> increases the effect of your Shadow Orb Power buff, which increases all period damage. Mastery also increases the damage bonus given to Mind Blasts and Mind Spikes when they consume Shadow Orbs.
    </section>
    <br />
    <section>
      <b>Critical Strike</b> increases the chance for each of your spells to deal critical damage. A critical hit will deal 200% of normal damage. Critical strikes will also reduce the cooldown of your Shadowfiend, your most important cool-down spell. Casted, channeled and instances of period damage can all land critical hits independently.

  <h2>Haste Caps</h2>
    Early priest playstyles would benefit greatly from as much haste as possible, however by the Firelands patch there is so much haste available that it is better to stop at specific caps. When you reach this point, it is always reccomended to aim for the +31.26% haste cap, but for your information, we have provided details of each haste cap that is available to priests.
  <section>
    <h3>Devouring Plague</h3>
    <p>
      At the +31.26% haste cap, Devouring Plague will have a total of three additional ticks. The second additional tick is granted at the other haste cap, +18.74%. The first additional tick is automatically gained simply from the use of Shadowform's Mind Quickening as well as Darkness talents.

    <h3>Shadow Word: Pain</h3>
    <p>
      While the +24.97% haste cap, which grants a second additional tick, is often the first one Shadow Priests will aim for, the other cap cannot be attained unless the Priest is a Goblin having the Warlock buff, Dark Intent with full T-13 Best in Slot gear. This final +41.67% haste cap grants the third additional tick. Again, t first additional tick is automatically gained simply from the use of Shadowform's Mind Quickening as well as Darkness talents.

  <section>
    <h3>Vampiric Touch</h3>
    <p>
      The +30.00% haste cap will grant the Priest a second additional tick of Vampiric Touch, with the first tick being given from the Shadowform's Mind Quickening as well as Darkness talent's passive bonuses to haste.
